# Roblox Lag Switch

**Roblox-LagSwitch** is a program designed to function as a lag switch for Roblox. It leverages Windows API hooks and firewall rules to toggle network connectivity for the RobloxPlayerBeta executable. This allows users to momentarily disrupt the connection, simulating lag for the other players.

## Features
- **Keyboard and Mouse Triggers:** Configurable triggers to activate/deactivate the lag switch.
- **Dynamic Process Detection:** Automatically locates the Roblox executable or allows manual selection.
- **Overlay Notifications:** Visual indicators for when the lag switch is toggled on or off.
- **Firewall Rule Management:** Seamless integration with Windows Firewall to control the network activity of the target process.

## Status
This project is **incomplete** and will not be continued. While the core functionality is implemented, it remains unpolished and is not production-ready. You are welcome to explore and modify the source code as needed.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Compile and run the application.
3. Use the user interface to set triggers and manage the lag switch functionality.

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9.0.
